# GSRI Zeus Manager

## What is GSRI Zeus Manager
GZM is an addon providing a set of functions allowing to handle who may become Zeus on your server.

With GZM enabled, you can simply stop thinking about placing game master modules in your missions. Authorization is handled at server level instead of mission, and can be updated live without the need for a mission restart.

*   No more copy/paste a pile of curator modules with players id as owners when creating a mission
*   No more mission modification + upload + restart to add/revoke a player's Zeus access
*   No more grant/revoke server admin privileges to zeuses when relying on `#adminLogged`

See *How to use this addon* to get a full description of the features.

## How to use this addon

### Requirements
GZM requires [CBA](https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3) to run.
Do not forget to install both mods on your clients and server as well.
GZM is interacted with in-game's text chat, which is only available in multiplayer games. This means GZM cannot be used in single-player scenarios.

### Features
GZM stores a whitelist of players allowed to become [curators](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3_Curator) on the server.
The whitelist is stored in the server [profile](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Profile) and is persisted accross missions and server restart.
The authorization process is handled at server level, which means that any whitelisted player may become a curator on *any mission run on this server*.
The stored data in the whitelist is, for each authorized player, hisÂ·her steamID (see [getPlayerUID](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/getPlayerUID)) and a nickname in order to ease whitelist's reviewing and revoking process.

When an authorized player request Zeus privileges, a custom [Game Master module](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3_Module:_Game_Master) is created and linked. This means that you may still rely on manually placed modules with player ID, slot name, and/or `#adminLogged` features in parallel : GZM will ignore third party modules.

### Usage
The addon uses in-game chat commands to manage both the whitelist and curator slots assignment:
*   `#gzm help` lists all commands and usage
*   `#gzm whitelist` lists all players in the curator whitelist
*   `#gzm promote <nickname> <steamID>` adds a player's steamID to the curator whitelist under the provided nickname.
*   `#gzm revoke <nickname>` removes an authorized steamID from the curator whitelist based on the provided nickname.
*   `#gzm [request|release]` assigns to or unassigns yourself from a curator slot

### Zeus players
First, ask a server administrator to promote you.
Once promoted, you may use `#gzm request` to become a curator on the mission.

If you don't need the curator slot anymore, you can `#gzm release` your slot.

### Mission editors
There is nothing to do ! GZM rely on server's [profileNamespace](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/profileNamespace), which means any mission run on an already-configured server will benefit from it.

If you want to use GZM when testing your mission, remember it uses game chat, which is **only available in multiplayer mode**. You will consequently need to [preview in multiplayer](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Eden_Editor:_Preview#Multiplayer).

### Server owners / admins
[Logged admins](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/serverCommandAvailable) are the only players allowed to modify the curators whitelist using `#gzm promote` and `#gzm revoke` commands.
Being a logged admin does not grant privilege to become curator by itself, you must add yourself to the whitelist.

To allow players to become logged admins on your server, add their player id to the `admins` property of your [server.cfg file](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/server.cfg).
All players in this list may become logged admins using the `#login` command in the chat.
Only add trustworthy people to this list, as logged admins can harm your server: `#lock`, `#kick`, `#shutdown` ...

**Sharing profile with multiple server instances is not supported** because BI does not provide a command to reload the profile files.
Using the same profile would provoke confusion and data loss on the whitelist.
If you have multiple servers, you have to manage a separate profile and whitelist on each server.

**Security notes**:
You could also rely on `passwordAdmin` instead of `admins` though this is not recommended: passwords are way easier to steal than steam accounts.
We also strongly recommend players with admin privileges on any server to enable [Steam Guard two-factor authentication](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1266-OAFV-8478#steamguard) on their account to prevent unauthorized access.
