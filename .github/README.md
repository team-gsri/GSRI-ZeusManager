# GSRI Zeus Manager

## What is GSRI Zeus Manager

It is a set of functions designed to rely on CBA custom command registering in order to interact with any Zeus module added in 3Den without having to link them independently.

With GZM enabled, you can simply place Zeus modules in your mission, and then rely on this access manager to allow some whitelisted players to request access to a curator.

See *How to use these scripts* to get a full description of the manager.
